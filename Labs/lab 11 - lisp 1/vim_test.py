This is a test of vim's capabilities.
I need to write a few lines.
So i can test (and learn a whole lot) whether i know what i am doing here.
is that fun? well, i really love vim, for some 
reason or another it really vibes with me and i regret
not having dedicated time during the last two years
to learning it. my mindset is different now and 
hopefully it is a mindset that can take me far.
